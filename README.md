# JavaScript Loose Comparison Pitfalls with Null and Zero Values

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error that arises from using loose comparison operators (||, ! ) instead of strict comparison (===, !==) when dealing with null and 0 values. Loose comparison can lead to unexpected behavior and bugs that are difficult to trace.

## The Bug
The bug lies in the unintended consequences of loose comparison in conditional statements.  Consider the following code example:

```javascript
function bar(a, b) {
  if (!a || !b) {
    return 0; // This is the buggy part
  }
  return a + b;
}
```

In this function, `!a` or `!b` evaluates to true not only when `a` or `b` is `null` or `undefined`, but also when `a` or `b` is `0`.

## The Solution
The solution involves using strict equality to correctly handle null values and distinguish them from 0.

```javascript
function foo(a, b) {
  if (a === null || b === null) {
    return 0; // This handles null values correctly
  }
  return a + b;
}
```

By using `===`, we ensure that the conditional only evaluates to `true` when a value is explicitly `null`.
